The

\section{Credit Paramaterisation under Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS)}

The Nelson-Siegel-Svensson formula is a simple extension to the Nelson-Siegel simplistic approach, providing an additional term to cope with a more stressed curve that is possible during a corporate credit event.
\begin{equation}
r(T) = \beta_0 + \displaystyle \frac{\beta_1(1-e^{-T/\tau})}{T/\tau} + \beta_2 \Bigg(\displaystyle \frac{1-e^{-T/\tau}}{T/\tau} - e^{T/\tau}\Bigg ) +  \beta_3 \Bigg(\displaystyle \frac{1-e^{-T/\tau_2}}{T/\tau_2} - e^{T/\tau_2}\Bigg )
\end{equation}
